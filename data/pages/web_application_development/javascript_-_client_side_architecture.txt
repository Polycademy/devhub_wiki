====== Javascript - Client Side Architecture ======

==== Client Side ====

=== OOP and Functional ===

=== HTML5 APIs ===

Browser level (for other stuff)

DOM level (for jQuery)

=== Observer Pattern ===

Event Driven Programming

=== AJAX ===

AJAX, Server Push, Long Poll, Sockets, RTC, Pusher API

=== Templating ===

Dust.js or doT.js or otherwise

Precompilation or lazy loading

=== Dependency Management ===

AMD vs CommonJS

Require.js

=== Web Workers ===

=== MVC Single Page Applications ===

Model being AJAX

View Model Bindings

Controller and Routing

=== File Uploading ===

OH FILE UPLOADING, two options use:

http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/ (bootstrap integration)

OR

http://www.plupload.com/ (very full featured but not integrated in bootstrap by default, lots of fallbacks for older browsers)

OR 

http://fineuploader.com/ (bootstrap integration)

They both require server side implementations!

Or if it's just front end, then just use File Picker (requires no server side implementation)
