====== Javascript - Design Patterns ======

Javascript is a very flexible language which is a double edged sword. It gives a lot of power to developers but it also provides the ability for sloppy coding. Due to the silent errors of javascript, it is often very dangerous to write bad code in javascript, as you won't know until something really breaks. The practice of javascript also incorporates the usage of the BOM and DOM APIs. The arrival of [[http://platform.html5.org/|HTML5]] increased the number of APIs and consequently the number of things we can do with javascript. This section discusses design patterns, practices, utilities and the usage of HTML5 APIs when writing javascript.
