====== Lesson 13 - WAP ======

**Expected Work**

  - Finish your header
  - Continue working on your HTML and LESS. Don't get overwhelmed with the amount of code, just reference the examples when you need to. Spend some time reading the external references.

**Agile**

  - What did you since last session
  - What do you want to achieve today
  - Any problems?

**Lecture**

  - Continue through the common UI examples
  - CSS Inheritance
  - Advanced Box Model with display rules, positioning rules, border-box and Bootstrap columns/grids
  - Vendor prefixes
  - Clearless Elements
  - OODA loop of web design and long term OODA loop
  - 43 days left!

**Practice**

  - Continue working through common UI
  - Try to get at least half of your main body done
  - When creating a new component or element, try to do it yourself via normal HTML, then google around or check the demos/docs for any examples. It's most likely that someone else has already done it before!
