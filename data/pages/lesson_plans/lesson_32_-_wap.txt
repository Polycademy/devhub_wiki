====== Lesson 32 - WAP ======

**Expected Work**

  - Implement your custom technology stack
  - Continue working to convert your server side application into an API to be used with an single page application
    - Route all resources to /api/resource, route everything else to Home. Use ''$this->resources''.
    - All controllers need Index, Show, Create, Update, Delete that corresponds to the route's Get Post Put and Delete
    - All controllers composer JSON not HTML
    - All models need CRUD and possibly "read_all" method.
    - Change form validation library to Polycademy/Validation
    - Input is acquired from ''$this->input->json''
    - All messages need to go through an output and input message mapper in the inflector helper to convert snake_case to camelCase and vice versa.
    - Implement CSRF by using the modified MY_Security library that does a CSRF verify on all requests except GET and on the HTTP header instead of the POST payload. Also make sure that the cookie name gets passed into javascript.
