====== Lesson 24 - WAP ======

**Expected Work**

  - Continue working on your MVC triads
  - Incorporate IonAuth and ACL as part of your authentication system, and extend if with groups relevant to your web application
  - Change all your controllers into "resources" and each method represents an HTTP method to manipulate that resource. So use the Pigeon library.

**Agile**

  - What did you since last session
  - What do you want to achieve today
  - Any problems?

**Lecture**

  - Revisit REST
  - Implement RESTful routing and making IonAuth RESTful
  - 32 days left!

**Practice**

  - Incorporate RESTful routing for all your controllers
  - Controllers are resources now, they are not pages or categories of pages
  - Incorporate IonAuth into your resources too
