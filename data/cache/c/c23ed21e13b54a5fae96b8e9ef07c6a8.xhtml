<p>
To start a project, we must first have an idea. We can start by brainstorming ideas or selecting from the <a href="/polycademy_projects/devhub_wiki/doku.php?id=wishlist" class="wikilink1" title="wishlist">Wishlist</a>. Once we have the idea, we then expand on the idea&#039;s feature set. These features are turned into a logical workflow of components. Then we can figure out what standards and technologies we will use in order to create it. This will give us an idea of the timing and deployment of the project.

<h2 class="sectionedit2" id="brainstorming">Brainstorming</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Creative brainstorming often relies on three aspects:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Individual reflection on <em>identifying problems</em>.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Inspiration, debate and constructive criticism from <em>different complex fields</em>.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Physical space that allows <em>interaction with diverse people</em>.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Scientific studies have shown that groups don&#039;t necessarily produce more ideas than individuals. While brainstorming sessions in groups were meant to sustain a no criticism rule, group dynamics stifle creative thought and some people are simply uncomfortable in groups. The individual needs to first reflect on problems. There is no point in thinking about solutions or the ideal product or service, if the problem isn&#039;t tackled first. People also find it easier to identify problems than ideal products. However don&#039;t let this stop you about dreaming about ideas that have no specific or defined problem. Henry Ford once said that if he asked what consumers want, they would have said a faster horse.
</p>

<p>
In this course, you may already arrive with a problem and solution set. If you don&#039;t have any specific ideas, this is when getting into groups is the most fun. After a problem has been identified by you or one of your group members, let people react to your problem and the proposed solution. Constructive criticism is a good thing in creative brainstorming as it allows people to reformulate the problem to take into account complex factors that the original definition did not attend to. Reformulating the problem or solution works best when it is inspired and debated from different perspectives and fields. The Medici effect is the phenomenon that breakthrough insights comes from an intersection of ideas, concepts and cultures. Allow the group to connect the dots between disparate fields. Remember too little familiarity between group members stifles interaction, but too much familiarity increases group think. 
</p>

<p>
The third points follows on from the second point. Get out there and talk to people you would normally never talk too! Innovative companies such as Vitra are designing workplaces that enhance serendipitous conversations by removing the cubicles and creating a balance between relaxed solitude and easy going sociability. Diverse people bring diverse backgrounds and cultures. In the modern day, there has been a greater focus on convergence and cross-disciplinary studies as modern complex problems are finding parallels in diverse academic fields.
</p>

<p>
Brainstorming doesn&#039;t stop after the problem has been defined and appropriate solution proposed. There is a cycle of brainstorming as the development of the solution meets unexpected threats and opportunities. So don&#039;t be afraid of going back to the drawing board, but make sure to keep in sight a constant theme and that is your vision.

<h2 class="sectionedit4" id="feature_set">Feature Set</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Once you have a problem and solution defined. It is time to define a feature set for the first iteration of the product. If the web application is content focused, then your feature set should involve categories of content. Each category of content solves a particular problem for your customer. If you were a comedy site, you could have lists, stand up videos, jokes and reviews. We will use the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum Viable Product" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum Viable Product">Minimum Viable Product</a> to create feature set.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT4 SECTION "Feature Set" [5094-5580] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit5" id="minimum_viable_product">Minimum Viable Product</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
MVP is defined in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> 1. as a smoke test of a whole product or a set of features. The MVP approach deploys a website or mock up of the service but has no real functionality. This is to test customer response.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> 2. to deploy a product that is minimum enough to produce quickly and viable enough so it is differentiated from the competition and actually useful.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For our purposes, the second definition of MVP is what we follow. However we&#039;ll also be executing the first way by iterating through the feature set when producing the product.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT5 SECTION "Minimum Viable Product" [5581-6167] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit6" id="feature_filtering">Feature Filtering</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
In order to create a MVP, we take all the ideas from the brainstorming stage and categorise the features into “core”, “value adding”, “optional” and “extraneous”. There are a lot of cool features we would want in our ideal solution, but we have limited time and budget.
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Core features relate to features that must exist for the product or service to actually do what it has to do. Imagine Gmail without an emailing feature, that would make Gmail completely useless. These features are necessary for your product to become minimum.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Value adding features are features that differentiate yourself from the competition. What makes this product or service unique and more valuable to your customer segment? These features are necessary for your product to become viable.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Optional features are features that can be value adding but are not necessary because either very few people will find it useful or you already have enough features that are value adding that make it unique and useful for your niche. These features are only useful for extreme use cases.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Extraneous features are features that are not needed or wanted because they either are useless or are not feasible with your resources and time.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is possible for value adding features to become core, optional features to become value adding and extraneous to become optional. This is based how you scale up your product or service in the future. But for development purposes, we will only focus on the core and value adding.
</p>

<p>
Once you have your features separated in core or value adding. Development will focus first on the core, then layer on the value adding. We&#039;ll forget about the optional and extraneous for our first iteration, but they will be in our long term roadmap.
</p>

<p>
From the feature set, we&#039;ll focus on what is in the core and the value adding. For each feature, conceptualise them in the form of a workflow component. It is important to map out the workflow or scenario of how someone will use the product. At the same time this will reveal the dependencies and the side effects of each feature.
</p>

<p>
Each feature/component will have some input that is fed into the logical processes and finally off to some output. The inputs and outputs could be triggers or meta information that needs to be processed. This way we create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_(computing)" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_(computing)">user based workflow</a> and the overall architecture of our application. This will be done during class. This becomes easier as you become more aware of the technologies that can be used.
</p>

<p>
Try drawing this workflow diagram and architecture on paper and iterate through different ones.
</p>

<p>
Each component can be further separated into more specific components. There may be components inside components. One component&#039;s output may lead to another component&#039;s input. There is not just one logical flow, but many different flows.
</p>

</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit8" id="standards_technologies">Standards &amp; Technologies</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Once we have a component workflow map and an idea of our overall architecture, we can then figure out what technologies are suitable to your project.
</p>

<p>
We&#039;ll need to figure out our solution stack, our development tools, our deployment mechanism, our hosts, and of course the appropriate skills and knowledge required to use these technologies.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully, web application development has many of these tools already, and these tools are widely available and are free. The world of development thrives on open source technology. With the wealth of opensource, it&#039;s the best time in history to begin software development.

Polycademy will be running its course with 3 philosophies. The first has already been explained as MVP. The second and third are flipped classroom and agile development. Flipped classroom is what you&#039;re doing right now. Read, watch and listen to material online and when you come to class we&#039;ll stick to being practical. Agile development is about rapid and flexible incremental iteration to code. Not only will you as a developer begin your development journey as an agile developer, but Polycademy will attempt to service you in an agile manner.

<p>
The <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" class="urlextern" title="http://agilemanifesto.org/"  rel="nofollow"> Agile Manifesto</a> was created by 17 developers in February 2001.
</p>

<p>
<em>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</em>
</p>

<p>
It has <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/general/the-principles-of-agile-development/" class="urlextern" title="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/general/the-principles-of-agile-development/"  rel="nofollow"> 12 principles</a>:
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="customer_satisfaction">1. Customer Satisfaction</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
<em>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</em>
</p>

<p>
As software developers, we should satisfy the customer through early, continuous and iterative delivery of features. This allows our customers to see real progress and provide early feedback. There&#039;s no need for stealth development, instead release early and release often.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="adapt_to_changing_requirements">2. Adapt to Changing Requirements</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
<em>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer&#039;s competitive advantage.</em>
</p>

<p>
If we are able to react quickly to changing requirements, then we are the best development for our customer. We do work in an just in time manner, and we make software finish faster and reap rewards faster. This is because we develop small pieces which allows us to take advantage of the changing landscape of opportunities.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="deliver_frequently">3. Deliver Frequently</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
<em>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</em>
</p>

<p>
Customers and developers become more confident as the features of our product are updated and deployed one by one. We won’t wake up after days or months of work, only to see that everything is going into the trash.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="work_together_frequently">4. Work Together Frequently</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
<em>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</em>
</p>

<p>
It is important to maintain communication between the business elements and the development team. As developers may speak a different language to business people, it is best to describe software features as a simple story with characters (who is it for), context (in what situation) and morals (why is it useful?).
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="build_projects_with_motivated_individuals">5. Build Projects with Motivated Individuals</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
<em>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</em>
</p>

<p>
Polycademy will try its earnest to create an engaging atmosphere and provide you the best tools to create your application.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="use_face_to_face_communication">6. Use Face to Face Communication</h4>
<div class="level4">
<div class="thumb2 tright" style="width:210px"><div class="thumbinner"><a href="/polycademy_projects/devhub_wiki/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Avision_and_plan&amp;media=web_application_development:daily_sprint_meeting.jpg" class="media" title="web_application_development:daily_sprint_meeting.jpg"><img src="/polycademy_projects/devhub_wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=200&amp;media=web_application_development:daily_sprint_meeting.jpg" class="mediabox2" alt="" width="200" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a class="internal" title="Enlarge" href="/polycademy_projects/devhub_wiki/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Avision_and_plan&amp;media=web_application_development:daily_sprint_meeting.jpg"><img width="15" height="11" alt="" src="/polycademy_projects/devhub_wiki/lib/plugins/imagebox/magnify-clip.png"/></a></div>Developers having a daily scrum <sup><a href="#fn__3" id="fnt__3" class="fn_top">3)</a></sup></div></div></div>
<p>
<em>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</em>
</p>

<p>
Learning is a social activity. Face to face communication is more engaging and creates a closer feedback loop with both your teacher and your peers. This is why Polycademy teaches in a physical manner but isn&#039;t afraid of taking advantage of online technologies to help. Being face to face also means when you ask a question, you&#039;ll get an answer immediately.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="measure_progress_with_working_software">7. Measure Progress with Working Software</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
<em>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</em>
</p>

<p>
In the end the customer wants a working product. It doesn&#039;t matter how to got there as long as you got there. While in Polycademy we&#039;ll advocate some tools, you&#039;re free to choose how you want to work.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="maintain_a_constant_pace">8. Maintain a Constant Pace</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
<em>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</em>
</p>

<p>
After committing to agile workflow for some time, it becomes easier to gauge the capacity of work a team can do, and so it becomes easier to estimate how long it will take to do something.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="pay_attention_to_industrial_progress">9. Pay Attention to Industrial Progress</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
<em>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</em>
</p>

<p>
As developers we are committed to life long learning. Our skills have a half-life of 5 years. We have to keep learning. Learning is fun!
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="simplicity_is_essential">10. Simplicity is Essential</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
<em>Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.</em>
</p>

<p>
<abbr title="Keep it simple stupid">KISS</abbr> means keep it simple stupid. Making something simple work is more difficult than making something complex. The more simpler the better. Forget technical innovation, if we can do it with sticks and stones, then it is better to do it that way. The same goes for development. There&#039;s a hundred ways to skin a cat, but the simplest is the best.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="self-organize">11. Self-Organize</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
<em>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</em>
</p>

<p>
As you develop with a team, the more you work, the more you discover ways you could have done things in the past better. This is especially true with software development. Often we don&#039;t know exactly our end product, so we keep ourselves lean and hungry to learn. Roles and workflows arise from self-organisation, these will hardly ever match the top-heavy plans we create at the start.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="reflect_and_adjust">12. Reflect and Adjust</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
<em>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</em>
</p>

<p>
We need to reflect on the software we build and the team we forge. This is essential when we&#039;re developing agilely, we need to know when something isn&#039;t working and adjust our direction. This has to be honest and regular.

<p>
There are many implementations of the agile philosophy such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme Programming" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme Programming">XP</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)">Scrum</a>. For Polycademy, we&#039;ll mix and match what works for the teacher and students.
</p>

<h4 id="sprint_review">Sprint Review</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
At the beginning of each week we&#039;ll review and recap on our theory and practice according to each student&#039;s respective user stories and code contributions. This will last only 30 minutes.
</p>

<p>
Polycademy will be checking up on your Github project profile to keep track of your progress. We&#039;ll let you know if we think your pace is too slow for your project to be done.
</p>

<p>
We are committed to constant deployment. We deploy all our features every week.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="daily_scrum">Daily Scrum</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
At the beginning of each session (day), we&#039;ll have a 5 - 10 minute stand up meeting. This session is for feedback between the members of each group or between the students and teachers. This is a good session to talk about what you want to achieve by the end of the day, what problems you&#039;re facing and what you need help with. Any important problems will be written on the whiteboard.
</p>

<p>
Here are our guidelines for the scrum:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> All members of the development Team come prepared with the updates for the meeting</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The meeting starts precisely on time even if some development team members are missing</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The meeting should happen at the same location and same time every day</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The meeting length is set (timeboxed) to 5 - 10 minutes</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> No detailed discussions shall happen in this meeting.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
During the meeting, each team member answers three questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> What have you done since yesterday?</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> What are you planning to do today?</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Any impediments/stumbling blocks?</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h4 id="development_philosophy">Development Philosophy</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Our development is time-boxed to keep it flexible. The quality and deadline of our product is fixed, but we can adjust the amount features we are going to release. Everyday is minor milestone, every week is a major milestone.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="session_time">Session Time</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Although we&#039;ll be doing practical work during the sessions, this will not be enough to complete your application. You need to work at home or at the classroom during downtime. You need to read the material on this codex or otherwise before you come to class. Polycademy will be moving on breakneck pace, don&#039;t fall behind.
