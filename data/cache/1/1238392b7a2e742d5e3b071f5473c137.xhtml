<p>
Aesthetics is defined as the branch of philosophy dealing with beauty and taste. It&#039;s not a hard science, most human appreciation of aesthetics comes from intuition. Intuition is created from repeated shared experience. The more experience you have, the more intuitive you are. The conclusion from this isn&#039;t that aesthetics cannot be taught, principles of aesthetics can be taught as there are shared aesthetic related knowledge passed down from generations of artists. However creativity relies on the individual, because learning the principles helps you create something awesome, but the spark of creation itself still requires your own imagination.

No one ever creates or postulates or designs in isolation. Human knowledge is built on top of previous efforts. Isaac Newton once said the only reason he could see far was because he stood on the shoulders of giants. After all great artists steal where mediocre artists copy. It&#039;s all about taking the best ideas from elsewhere and bringing them into what you&#039;re doing. Refer to this Nettut&#039;s article on <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/design-theory/concept-and-inspiration-design-theory-for-web-designers/" class="urlextern" title="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/design-theory/concept-and-inspiration-design-theory-for-web-designers/"  rel="nofollow">Concept and Inspiration</a>.

Before hitting pen to paper, ask yourself these questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Who is your target audience?</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> What do people expect of similar web applications or similar contexts?</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> What are the use contexts for your application? How would one of your target audience use it?</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> What message are you trying to communicate?</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> What is your philosophy? What is your purpose? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA" class="urlextern" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA"  rel="nofollow">Why do you do what you do?</a></div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Then construct your theme with those answers in mind. Your design can then flow from that. I specifically like designing the logo first and basing the colour scheme from the colours on the logo. But your mileage may vary.

You can learn more about startup branding from Eric Ries&#039;s <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/" class="urlextern" title="http://theleanstartup.com/"  rel="nofollow">lean startup book</a>. Startups don&#039;t usually have money and marketing team to build up a pervasive brand, but it is still possible by identifying your product market fit and learning as quickly as possible whether something is working or not.

<div class="level2">

<p>
Colour Theory actually covers a number of things, but at the most basic level it is the interaction of different colours in a design through meaning, complementation, contrast, vibrancy and schemes. It&#039;s also quite subjective in that different cultures see colours differently, the below advice applies mostly to a Western audience, ask your target market for their perspective if you&#039;re looking to do international expansion.

<p>
The best way to get started working with colours is to use <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/" class="urlextern" title="https://kuler.adobe.com/"  rel="nofollow">Adobe&#039;s Kuler tool</a>. Hit the create button and start playing around. Make sure to use the <a href="/doku.php?id=web_application_development:solution_stack#front_end_debugging" class="wikilink1" title="web_application_development:solution_stack">ColorZilla extension</a> to grab the colour code of colours you see on the web.
</p>

<p>
Colours on computers are represented in mainly RGB or Hex values. RGB means red, green, blue. Basically these three colours can be mixed together to represent any colour. Hex values are the standard method of designating colours on <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> stylesheets for websites. So we&#039;ll need to convert any colours we like to these values if we want to use them. Kuler automatically does this for you.

<h3 class="sectionedit5" id="colour_meaning">Colour Meaning</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Colours have been used to represent abstract feelings, emotions or ideas. Different cultures experience this differently. This section will gloss over various different colours and their respective meanings in the context of web design. Refer to Smashing Magazine article on <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/28/color-theory-for-designers-part-1-the-meaning-of-color/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/28/color-theory-for-designers-part-1-the-meaning-of-color/"  rel="nofollow">colour meaning</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>
Note that although singular colours may have their own meanings, the real fun begins when you combine meanings of different colours together. For example, the Polycademy logo of red and blue is to elicit emotions of fun and creativity playing with play dough or toys.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="warm_colours">Warm Colours</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Warm colours include red, orange, and yellow, and variations of those three colours. Use warm colours in your designs to reflect passion, happiness, enthusiasm, and energy.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Red - is associated with violence, importance, danger and passion. In web design, red can be used as a powerful accent to give distinctiveness to important elements. Brighter versions of red can be energetic, while darker shades elicit power and elegance. Use red to make people focus!</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Orange - is associated with vibrancy and energy. It can be used to denote change, movement, health, vitality and fun. It is considered friendly and inviting.&#039;</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Yellow - is the brightest of colours. It&#039;s associated with happiness and sunshine. You can use yellow to highlight important actions or messages. Yellows are commonly used for gender-neutral sites for children. Dark yellow can denote antiques or olden times.</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h4 id="cool_colours">Cool Colours</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Cool colors include green, blue, and purple, are often more subdued than warm colors. They are the colors of night, of water, of nature, and are usually calming, relaxing, and somewhat reserved.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Green - is a very earthy colour. It can represent environment related themes, new beginnings, growth, renewal and abundance. Green is often used with blue to calm people down, and it&#039;s also the colours of Earth! Green can have a stable meaning and appropriate for business, wealth and nature.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Blue - is associated with calmness and responsibility. Light blues can be refreshing and watery like. Dark blue can be mysterious or stable. Blue can be used for peace and co-operation. Blues are often used with boring corporate sites.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Purple - is associated with royalty, wealth and being romantic. Use dark purple to give a sense of luxury.</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h4 id="neutral_colours">Neutral Colours</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Neutral colors often serve as the backdrop in design. They’re commonly combined with brighter accent colors. But they can also be used on their own in designs, and can create very sophisticated layouts. 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Black - is associated with formality, seriousness, rebellion, mystery, death and evil. A strong black theme is usually used in edgier designs, but it can also be used in conservative sites. Black is most commonly used for typography because of its neutrality.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> White - is associated with purity, cleanliness, virtue, and the health industry. White is used as a background for websites, and lets other colours demand more attention. It is popular in minimalist designs where it provides “whitespace”.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Gray - is associated with conservatism, formality, professionalism, and being distinguished. It&#039;s commonly used in formal corporate sites. But also for embroidery and minimalist embellishment. Gray is used in typography when you want to show secondary information that contrasts against the primary focus.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Brown - is associated with earth, wood, and stone. In design, brown is commonly used as a background color. It’s also seen in wood textures and sometimes in stone textures. It helps bring a feeling of warmth and wholesomeness to designs.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Beige &amp; Tan - has little meaning. It has the warmth of brown and the coolness of white, and, like brown, is sometimes seen as dull. It’s a conservative color in most instances, and is usually reserved for backgrounds.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Cream and Ivory - is similar to white but has the features of brown giving it a feeling of elegance, coffee and sweetness. Can be used for food sites.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are number of concepts in colours that web designers use. You can start using these in your vocabulary when talking to other designers. Use Kuler to manipulate the parameter values to see the differences in colours. In using the concepts below, the thing to remember is that all use of colours is to either contrast different things, or group related things. Things can be concepts, elements, meanings, pretty much anything. It&#039;s best to be consistent, so if warning messages are colours with red background and white foreground, then all warning messages should have these colours. It allows your users quick identification after one use.
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Contrast - is simply a difference in between foreground and background colour. A high contrast clearly differentiates elements from each other, this is usually represented by black text on white background or the other way around. A low contrast can offer a slightly less differentiation allowing you group similar but different elements together. Contrast is what you use to make the user focus on something.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Hue - is the correct term for “colour”. A colour&#039;s hue is “the degree to which a stimulus can be described as similar to or different from stimuli that are described as red, green, blue, and yellow”. When designers say this website&#039;s main hue is red. They mean that the website has a dominant colour of red.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="thumb2 tright" style="width:210px"><div class="thumbinner"><a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Aaesthetic_foundations&amp;media=web_application_development:panelfly.jpg" class="media" title="web_application_development:panelfly.jpg"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=200&amp;media=web_application_development:panelfly.jpg" class="mediabox2" alt="" width="200" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a class="internal" title="Enlarge" href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Aaesthetic_foundations&amp;media=web_application_development:panelfly.jpg"><img width="15" height="11" alt="" src="/lib/plugins/imagebox/magnify-clip.png"/></a></div>Demonstrates chroma based gradients</div></div></div><ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Chroma - refers to the purity of a color. A hue with high chroma has no black, white or gray in it. Adding white, black or gray reduces its chroma. Chroma can be thought of as the brightness of a color in comparison to white. High chroma colours are quite vibrant and “colourful”. Use them to highlight elements. Slowly adjusting chromas allows you to create gradients that have a 3D effect, that is it seems like light is shining on it.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Saturation - refers to the way a hue looks under different lighting conditions. If you design a website with different hues but the same saturation, it will look unified. If they have different saturations, it looks jarring because it&#039;s as if there are different lights pointing in different directions and with different intensities. Highly saturated colours look washed out, whereas lowly saturated colours are very vibrant. This allows you to execute contrast with a high/low saturated background against low/high saturated foreground. This can create a depth of field effect simulating the way our eyes make the foreground seem closer and 3 dimensional. It&#039;s kind of like those professional wedding photos.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Value - refers to how light or dark your colour is. Black has a low value, whereas white has the highest value. Colours with high chroma (no black/white/gray) and differing values create contrasting vibrancy, allowing you to separate your content from header to main to footer.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="thumb2 tright" style="width:210px"><div class="thumbinner"><a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Aaesthetic_foundations&amp;media=web_application_development:lakesideheritage.jpg" class="media" title="web_application_development:lakesideheritage.jpg"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=200&amp;media=web_application_development:lakesideheritage.jpg" class="mediabox2" alt="" width="200" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a class="internal" title="Enlarge" href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Aaesthetic_foundations&amp;media=web_application_development:lakesideheritage.jpg"><img width="15" height="11" alt="" src="/lib/plugins/imagebox/magnify-clip.png"/></a></div>Good use of gray tone creating an elegant and vintage look</div></div></div><ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Tones - refers to when gray is added to a hue. Tones are generally duller or softer-looking than pure hues. Tones with more gray can lend a certain vintage feel to websites. Use tones when you want something separate content but you don&#039;t want the user to notice it, as it&#039;s easily forgettable when pitted against a white or black background.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Shades - refers to when black is added to a hue. This makes the colour darker. Instead of using black backgrounds, most backgrounds are shades of different colours. Combining it with tints obviously result in contrast.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Tints - refers to when white is added to a hue. This makes the colour lighter.</div>

<h3 class="sectionedit7" id="colour_schemes">Colour Schemes</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Colour schemes are arrangements of a set colours to accentuate complementation or contrast. Web designers use colour schemes to provide a consistent palette for their websites. There are various ways to construct a colour schemes, but they are all based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel" class="urlextern" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel"  rel="nofollow">colour wheel</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Aaesthetic_foundations&amp;media=web_application_development:color_star-en.svg.png" class="media" title="web_application_development:color_star-en.svg.png"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=web_application_development:color_star-en.svg.png" class="mediacenter" alt="" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Types of standard colour schemes:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Analogous - Analogous color scheme is based on a set of colours that are next to each other on the colour wheel. These colours will have the same amount chroma, but on Kuler you can adjust the chroma for all of them at once. For the purposes of web design, having the same amount chroma doesn&#039;t allow you to make enough contrast for foreground/background/highlighting, so you&#039;ll need to modify them.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Monochromatic - Monochromatic colour schemes are made up of different tones, shades and tints within a specific hue. These are the simplest color schemes to create, as they’re all taken from the same hue, making it harder to create a jarring or ugly schemes. You can then use the different shades or tints to differentiate text from background or header from main or article from sidebar.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Triad - Triads are a triangular formation of colours on the colour wheel. Use this to get a diversity of colours to use.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Complementary - Complementary colour schemes are opposite to each other on the colour wheel. Use this when you need to make a two things really contrast against each other. Improper use of these will create jarring experiences. Sometimes in web design, you&#039;ll have two of these colours right next to each other. A way to resolve this is by adding whitespace between or a small transitional colour between them as a border or separation.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Compound - Compound colour schemes are also called split complementary. You split it at complementary and only use one side of the colour wheel. Similar to the triad, you&#039;ll get a diverse colour set.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The trick is to create your own custom colour scheme, and stick to it consistently. Don&#039;t be afraid to test out different colours, and swap it out with something different. Nothing&#039;s concrete with design.

<div class="level2">

<p>
The composition of websites is the way you layout different elements. You could all of these composition concepts without applying any colour concepts except shades and use it to wireframe your site. This allows you to quickly test if your webpage will look right on paper, and iterate via several different leads before settling on the one that works. Remember different cultures demand more intense scrutiny!

<h3 class="sectionedit9" id="visual_hierarchy">Visual Hierarchy</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Visual hierarchy is important because we humans don&#039;t grasp all information equally. We only process what we think is important. In fact when we read sentences, we don&#039;t even read each character. We want to focus on the important bits. Therefore designers need to consider visual hierarchy. All elements on a web application need to be designed so that the important things are hierarchically on top. The important things change of course according individual needs and contexts. So you either design so there are multiple paths a user can take to cater to themselves, or you design for a specific segment or specific customer type and use case.

<p>
Various eye tracking studies on websites have shown that surfers read the screen in an “F” pattern. Seeing the top, upper left corner and left sides of the screen most. Then occasionally taking glances towards the right side of the screen. These eyetracking studies argue in favor of placing the most important elements of your site (branding, navigation, call to action) on the left side of the design.
</p>

<p>
One important lesson of this is from Facebook. Facebook often puts advertisements on the right. In fact most professional content sites put adverts on the right. The F layout dictates that things on the right are read less than things on the left, and even less so when users scroll down the page. Think like bullet points, you look for the indicator/marker for important content. So Facebook makes the right side fixed, so the advertisements scroll down with the user. This also means things on the top are more higher value and command higher bids than things on the bottom.
</p>

<p>
As users scroll down, increasingly they&#039;ll only look at the left side. You can break this up by adding elements that break up the page horizontally while they scroll down. This will refresh their eyes to do another F track.

<h4 id="visual_direction">Visual Direction</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Visual direction is controlling the eye movement of the user; this can be achieved by carefully selecting your images and by well-placed and aligned design elements.
</p>

<p>
You can first guide the direction of eye sight via images. The most obvious are arrow images. You can do this by placing photos of arrows or slanting lines in the foreground or background. Another way is the direction people are looking. Think back to movies. Have you ever seen a camera following the main actor and in the direction that he&#039;s walking, he&#039;s right up against the edge of the screen? Yes? Well then you watched a bad movie. The edge of the screen should always be farthest away from the direction of where the actor is looking or moving towards. The same principle is true in web design.

<p>
Examining the visual direction of elements and the distance that the eye needs to travel can show where layouts can be improved to shorten the time to do some action and hence improving user experience for work related applications.

</div>

<h4 id="size">Size</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
This should be obvious. Bigger elements denote more attention than smaller elements. However this can be subverted by using a small element with a large amount of whitespace. There was once a BMC Mini advert that went against the grain by producing a poster with a small car in the middle of large amount of whitespace.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="alignment">Alignment</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Alignment is about order between elements. Elements are usually grouped together in different hierarchies and these can be demonstrated by drawing a horizontal or vertical line between the grouped elements. Alignment can also align to user expectations of similar applications/websites. Users expect the logo to be up the top, so you can either be conservative by aligning your logo on the top, or shock them by putting it somewhere else. By creating consistent alignment, you&#039;ll help your users get used to the way your web application works.
</p>

<p>
Unconventional alignment can also be done. Ironically being unconventional doesn&#039;t mean you shouldn&#039;t be consistent with that unconventional style across pages. However make sure the context fits your design. If your application is work related, don&#039;t surprise your users with needless aesthetics. Surprise instead with functionality and intelligence! Games on the other hand can use unconventional styles to elicit interest and engagement.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="proximity">Proximity</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Elements that are close to each other are related, elements that are far away from each are not. Use proximity for menus or action points. Don&#039;t make your user work at hunting that menu button on your site by putting it far away from each other.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="density_whitespace">Density &amp; Whitespace</h4>
<div class="level4">
<div class="thumb2 tright" style="width:210px"><div class="thumbinner"><a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Aaesthetic_foundations&amp;media=web_application_development:11.jpg" class="media" title="web_application_development:11.jpg"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=200&amp;media=web_application_development:11.jpg" class="mediabox2" alt="" width="200" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a class="internal" title="Enlarge" href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Aaesthetic_foundations&amp;media=web_application_development:11.jpg"><img width="15" height="11" alt="" src="/lib/plugins/imagebox/magnify-clip.png"/></a></div>Demonstration of density and whitespace</div></div></div>
<p>
A related concept to proximity. Densely packing elements into a space makes it feel “heavy” and cluttered; When elements are spaced out too much, they may lose the relationships to one another. When a page is designed “just right”, the eye will easily recognize when elements are related and when they aren’t.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="repetition_symmetry">Repetition &amp; Symmetry</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Repetition can be about highlighting particular ideas, or about consistency. In the context of layout design, repetition is more for consistency. In order to highlight particular ideas, use repetition in your web copy.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT9 SECTION "Visual Hierarchy" [15166-20858] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit10" id="grids">Grids</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Web designers often use grids to help them with their layout composition. You want to minimise the amount of times you&#039;re pulling out the calculator. You can use grids in photoshop, and css grids on the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> &amp; <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> code. We&#039;ll be using 960 grid for our Photoshop grids, and Twitter Bootstrap for our <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> &amp; <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> grids. Mobile designs would of course require an adjustment of our 960 grid.

<h4 id="golden_ratio">Golden Ratio</h4>
<div class="level4">
<div class="thumb2 tright" style="width:210px"><div class="thumbinner"><a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Aaesthetic_foundations&amp;media=web_application_development:das-design-des-apple-logos-700x500-700.jpg" class="media" title="web_application_development:das-design-des-apple-logos-700x500-700.jpg"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=200&amp;media=web_application_development:das-design-des-apple-logos-700x500-700.jpg" class="mediabox2" alt="" width="200" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a class="internal" title="Enlarge" href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Aaesthetic_foundations&amp;media=web_application_development:das-design-des-apple-logos-700x500-700.jpg"><img width="15" height="11" alt="" src="/lib/plugins/imagebox/magnify-clip.png"/></a></div>Apple&#039;s logo is designed with the Golden Ratio</div></div></div>
<p>
The golden ratio is a mathematical formula that exists in nature, architecture, paintings and music. The golden ratio is specifically 1 to 1.618. You can then use this to create the golden rectangle. Artists and architects naturally proportioned their designs according to the golden ratio. The theory is that it naturally triggers feelings of natural balance.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Aaesthetic_foundations&amp;media=web_application_development:golden_rectangle.jpg" class="media" title="web_application_development:golden_rectangle.jpg"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=400&amp;media=web_application_development:golden_rectangle.jpg" class="mediacenter" alt="" width="400" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Correspondingly, websites can also be divided into the golden ratio. Think about the landscape design of our monitors. Our eyes are naturally proportioned to be more horizontal than vertical. This makes sense since we&#039;re a land creature, and we need to see prey and predators horizontally but not really vertically. Therefore our site can be landscape golden rectangle, and then you can separate sections according to the ratio.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="rule_of_thirds">Rule of Thirds</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
The rule of thirds come from the art of photography. It&#039;s actually quite close to the golden ratio.
</p>

<p>
First divide your canvas equally horizontally and vertically by three. You get nine equal rectangles. You&#039;ll see four intersection points.
</p>

<p>
Aline things that are long and straight to the lines. Align points of interest to the points of intersection. In web design, a sidebar can be considered lone and straight, align it with your first vertical line. Then you can adjust so that the points are pointing main elements such as the title of your article, a particular photo, navigation or whatever else you want your user to look at.

<h3 class="sectionedit11" id="typography">Typography</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Typography is probably the most common and important element of web design. It is way we design our written language, which is other than spoken language the primary form of communication. The concepts above also apply to typography. Consider this image which shows that the principles of visual hierarchy has been applied to the bottom typographical layout:
</p>

<p>
<a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Aaesthetic_foundations&amp;media=web_application_development:2.jpg" class="media" title="web_application_development:2.jpg"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=500&amp;media=web_application_development:2.jpg" class="mediacenter" alt="" width="500" /></a>
</p>

<p>
For web designers, the main things we have to consider when designing typography are:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Font Choices - It&#039;s best to choose 3 - 4 fonts and use them consistently. I prefer using sans-serif fonts for titles and short copy text, and serif fonts for long text. Serif fonts we&#039;re originally created to make it easier to distinguish each character, so I believe it&#039;s the best for long paragraphs. Sans-serif looks more modern and the famous display font Helvetica is based off it. Try using <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/"  rel="nofollow">Font Squirrel</a> for web usable fonts. Your fonts should somewhat be related to their context. If you use serif fonts for headings, then your site is more geared towards elegance or olden times or specific cultures. Refer to this <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/2008/04/04/on-choosing-type/" class="urlextern" title="http://ilovetypography.com/2008/04/04/on-choosing-type/"  rel="nofollow">article for more information on choosing fonts</a>.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Font Size - This is the same as sizing issue. Headers and markers/indicators should have a different larger font size then normal text. Fluid design also dictates we should use fluid font sizes, that is font sizes that adjust to the screen and user configuration. Use similar sizing to dictate similar groups of content. You have to consider different use cases, your user may be looking at it on a mobile screen, big screen TV or computer monitor.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Line Height - Squeezed in text is hard to read. Increase your line height so that it matches your font size. Sometimes it&#039;s good to be even bigger. Many websites have far too small font size and line height for their text heavy content. If someone is meant to be reading that, make it easy to read, so easy that you don&#039;t have to focus or put on glasses. Make it big. Refer to <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3285-the-typography-and-layout-behind-the-new-signal-vs-noise-redesign" class="urlextern" title="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3285-the-typography-and-layout-behind-the-new-signal-vs-noise-redesign"  rel="nofollow">37 Signals</a> and check out how their blog makes everything easy to read.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Letter Width - This is of course similar to line height. Increase your letter width so that the characters are appropriately spaced out. But if they are too far away from each other, it will become harder to read.</div>
</li>
</ul>
