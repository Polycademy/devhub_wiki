<abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> is a server side scripting language. It is a dynamic and interpreted language. <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> is not compiled. It runs through an interpreter, which is usually a <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> processor module that is integrated into a web server. For our purposes, that would be the Apache <abbr title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> server which includes <code>mod_php</code> as the processor module. <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> can also be ran as <abbr title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</abbr>, but that is not as common as the <code>mod_php</code> method. It started out being an embedded scripting language to <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, but grew into a full fledged programming language. It includes its own command line interface and can run as a stand alone server (but only used for development). It is single threaded and share nothing, meaning that it doesn&#039;t natively support concurrent processing and it doesn&#039;t share data between processes. <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> is currently the most widely used web programming language powering Wikipedia, Facebook, Digg and more.

<h2 class="sectionedit2" id="object_oriented_programming_oop">Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
There four fundamental <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming paradigm" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming paradigm">programming paradigms</a>. They are object-oriented, imperative, functional and logic programming. <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> can support multiple paradigms, namely procedural (imperative) and object oriented. It incorporates aspects of functional, but developers don&#039;t architect their <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> applications in a functional way. The most common programming paradigm for <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> is object oriented.
</p>

<p>
Object oriented simply means that we try to separate our programming into logical units of code. Each unit of code is an object. Each object can have multiple data properties that describe the object and multiple functions called methods. When we normally start programming, we naturally start in a procedural manner, specifying a list of tasks and subroutines before getting an end result. However in OOP, each object is an independent unit of code capable of receiving input, processing data and returning output. Each object can call on other objects, be dependent on external objects, or extended from parent objects. Each object has a distinct role. The decision of how granular we want when separating code into objects depends on the complexity of the unit of code. If you can find yourself doing multiple different <em>types</em> of tasks in one subroutine, then it&#039;s probably time to separate each <em>type</em> of functionality into different objects or different object methods. Objects should be created with one single responsibility, one way to check if an object is doing too many things is checking how many <code>if</code> or <code>switch</code> statements that are used to branch off logic. This is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single responsibility principle" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single responsibility principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a>
</p>

<p>
In order to create objects, we actually first specify a class. Classes are blueprints for objects. Objects are actually <em>instances</em> of classes. So a single class can be used to create multiple objects. Note that the words objects and classes are used interchangeably. However when people say class it usually refers to the creation of the class, whereas when people refer to object, it usually refers to instantiated context of the class.
</p>

<p>
It&#039;s important to note that by convention we name our classes with capitalised first letters and the rest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase">camel cased</a>. Except when we&#039;re naming interfaces or abstracts. Furthermore we put each class into its own single file, so there&#039;s never two classes in one file. The file name should also match the name of the class including the capitalisations. This file naming convention however is not applied when we&#039;re using models, views or controllers in Codeigniter. The reason for this is due to a mismatch of conventions between the PSR autoloading standards and Codeigniter.
</p>
<pre class="code php"><span class="co1">//a class of Elephant, classes are usually capitalised</span>

<p>
OOP has four main concepts: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. 
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT2 SECTION "Object Oriented Programming (OOP)" [1096-4127] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit3" id="encapsulation">Encapsulation</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
OOP arose from the need to modularise and separate the functionality of software as software grew in complexity. The OOP approach encourages encapsulation which means we should place units of data inside objects which can only be accessed and manipulated through the object&#039;s methods. The methods act as intermediaries between different objects. You should never access data properties from the object directly.
</p>

<p>
The motivation for encapsulation is discipline and abstraction. By encapsulating the data properties and thus the state of the object, we&#039;re hiding the implementation details of the object, but instead providing an method <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> that external objects can access. This helps with the abstraction process by providing a consistent way of accessing objects. This discipline is also useful when software development takes place in teams.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore since the data properties are hidden, and only the names of methods are accessible, we can change the implementation details of the object without worrying of breaking the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for other objects.

</div>
<!-- EDIT3 SECTION "Encapsulation" [4128-6151] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit4" id="abstraction">Abstraction</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Encapsulation is actually technique of a more generic concept called abstraction. Objects should be abstracted. This means that the concrete implementation details should be hidden and abstracted away, so that only contextually important methods are available at a particular perspective. Here&#039;s a couple examples: the concept of a “List” is an abstraction of “Fruit List” or “Car List”. The concept of a “Living Thing” is an abstraction of “Animals” which is an abstraction of “Dog”. The concept of “People” is an abstraction of the person “Roger” and “Matthew”. When constructing an object, the available object properties should be relevant to the context of which it is used. All “People” may have heights and weights, but only “Roger” has a preference for “Action Movies” and only “Matthew” has a tattoo saying “I&#039;m Awesome”. So when I&#039;m defining the “People” object, it should not have properties of movie preferences or tattoos, those are not contextually relevant to how I would perceive or represent “People” as an abstract concept.
</p>

<p>
Abstraction is achieved by encapsulating concrete implementation details, but it can also be achieved by leaving concrete implementation details later to extend the abstract class as the parent class.

</div>
<!-- EDIT4 SECTION "Abstraction" [6152-7418] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit5" id="inheritance">Inheritance</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Inheritance can be used to establish an abstract hierarchy of concepts and objects. At the same time because we&#039;re not rewriting the parent class&#039;s code, we enhance code reuse. Essentially child classes can inherit from parent classes, so that it inherits its parent&#039;s properties and methods.
</p>

<p>
Methods specified in the parent classes can be overwritten by child classes unless finalised with <code>final <em>scope</em> function <em>name</em>{}</code>. <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> also does not support multiple inheritance, so a child can only inherit from one parent. However there are different strategies to overcome this. Classes can also chain inheritance.

<h3 class="sectionedit6" id="polymorphism">Polymorphism</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Simply put polymorphism is simply that classes can have different functionality and yet share the same interface. Essentially you would be able to call a method that has a name, that is shared by classes which occupy the same abstraction level, but have different functionality. The point is so that you can write less code by not having to specify <code>if</code> statements to switch functionality based on some context. This also means when you&#039;re working in teams you can establish a standard for <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> methods for similar classes.
</p>

<p>
An example would be a button. Everybody knows how to interact with a button. You either press it or you don&#039;t. But what the button does, who knows? So all buttons should have the same interface, such as a method called <code>press</code>.
</p>

<p>
Polymorphism is supported by two extra constructs: Interfaces and Abstracts.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Interfaces are contracts that objects implement. An object can implement multiple interfaces. An interface is simply an empty class with named methods, but no implementation details inside the methods. Any class that implements an interface will have to create concrete methods that match the empty methods in the interface, it they don&#039;t, it will cause a fatal error. By using interfaces you&#039;re guaranteeing that your implemented objects will have a set of public <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> methods.
</p>

<p>
Interfaces support polymorphism because different objects can implement the same interface. If we take the button example, there could be a button interface, which red button and green button implements.

<p>
Interfaces can also include constants which are accessible statically in their implementing objects. See the <a href="#using_libraries" title="web_application_development:php_-_server_side_architecture ↵" class="wikilink1">Using Libraries</a> section for more on static classes. Interfaces can also be extended, this allows interfaces to occupy multiple levels of abstraction. You can have a <code>interface iLivingThing</code> which is an abstraction of <code>interface iAnimal</code>.
</p>

<p>
Interfaces are most commonly used with type hints to enforce type checking when injecting dependencies. See <a href="/doku.php?id=web_application_development:php_-_design_patterns" class="wikilink1" title="web_application_development:php_-_design_patterns">PHP - Design Patterns</a> for more information on dependency injection.

<p>
The practice of using interfaces with type hinting and dependency injection is important, as it modularises the dependencies of classes. The Calculation class depends on an object that implements the iAdd interface. It doesn&#039;t care what the passed in object is, as long as it has the methods specified in the interface, because it&#039;s expecting to use those methods. Therefore, this also loosens the dependency coupling, allowing us to swap out the Calculator object with a different object with different implementation details as long as it preserves the polymorphic method names and expected output.
</p>

<p>
This practice is quite useful when you need to abstract the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> (the way you use something) away from the concrete implementation (what the something is). One example would be if you&#039;re using a class that needs to store data into a database. That class should not care what kind of database it is, and how it stores its data as long as it has access to a set of predictable <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> methods. If you hard coded the database dependency and decided to change the database some time later, then you would have to change all the method calls, which is not good for maintenance. By using an interface, you avoid all of that by simply swapping out the database class and implementing the interface. Of course this only works if you abide by type hinting and dependency injection.
</p>

<p>
Note that objects can implement multiple interfaces, this just makes the instantiation of the object more strict, in that they have to implement all the methods specified in the interfaces.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="abstracts">Abstracts</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Abstracts are interfaces that allow concrete implementations of their methods, however classes extend abstracts instead of implementing them, this means only one abstract can be used for each object. You might then think why can&#039;t we just use a normal class and have children that extend it. Well you could, but in programming, it&#039;s good to be explicit. Think of abstracts as a strict possessive parent class that must have children, and then forces its children to do things their way. But at the same time, it provides shared methods to their children to use. Hence abstracts are never used by themselves.
</p>

<p>
Developers use abstracts to provide a boilerplate classes. Abstract methods which are the ones that children are forced to implement have to be either scoped at protected or public. Private wouldn&#039;t work.

<h2 class="sectionedit7" id="model_view_controller_mvc">Model View Controller (MVC)</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The model view controller pattern is an architecture pattern that separates software applications into three areas. The model is the business logic and application data. The view is the presentational user interface of the data. The controller is what binds the model&#039;s data to the view inputs, and it also routs user input requests to the appropriate interactions. The central ideas of the MVC pattern is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code reuse" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code reuse">code re-usability</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation of concerns" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation of concerns">separation of concerns</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/damiansromek/thin-controllers-fat-models-proper-code-structure-for-mvc" class="urlextern" title="http://www.slideshare.net/damiansromek/thin-controllers-fat-models-proper-code-structure-for-mvc"  rel="nofollow">thin controllers - fat models</a>.
</p>

<p>
MVC architecture is usually placed behind a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front Controller pattern" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front Controller pattern">front controller</a>. These front controllers essentially establish the workflow and middleware for every request and response. The front controller may include a router, or the router may be part of the middleware. The router routs requests to the appropriate controller which then calls upon its models and views to produce a response.
</p>

<p>
Codeigniter is an MVC framework. The code you write is separated into models, views and controllers. We also further separate our code into libraries, packages and helpers, but that&#039;s for later. Codeigniter also includes a front controller which is the index.php at your project root. Codeigniter automatically routs requests in the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> to the controller with a matching name, however this can be customised in the routes.php. The Apache <abbr title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> server actually sends all requests to the index.php, the index.php then calls upon the rest of the architecture and produces a response. No other files in Codeigniter is accessed directly. This gives an easy way to hook into the request and response flow and introduce middleware.
</p>

<p>
Note that there is a many to many relationship between models, controllers and views. One controller may call upon multiple models and multiple views. Models don&#039;t call controllers or views, and views don&#039;t call controllers or models. They simply return data to the controller that called them. Therefore models and views can have multiple controllers that interact with them.
</p>

<p>
Interfaces, abstracts and further inheritance can be applied to Codeigniter&#039;s models, views and controllers. However this practice is uncommon. I recommend you to use only these features in libraries or packages, and follow Codeigniter extension suggestions in their userguide if you need customised functionality in the architecture.

<p>
Your models is where your business logic and application data resides. Your models should contain the bulk of your operations and processing. Models also contain accessors and mutators to your database if any. It&#039;s important to understand that models aren&#039;t just for storing state, but also the operations on the behaviour of your system. If you were writing a Chess game, not only would the storage of the chess board state be via the model, but also the rule checking algorithms and artificial intelligence. Once this business logic finds itself needed in other areas, that&#039;s when you abstract it into its own package or library. That way it can be called and executed in multiple models.
</p>

<p>
Models return processed data to the controller. Models don&#039;t need to know where it gets called, just that it does.
</p>

<p>
Models can also perform data validation, but data validation that involves simply input filtering for security purposes should be left to the controller, because that&#039;s metaphorically the gate to your software fortress. However if the data validation requires business logic to be performed, such as checks against the database, then the it should be placed in the model. However opinions may vary on this suggestion.

<h3 class="sectionedit9" id="view">View</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Your view is where your user interface code lies. Remember that <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> markup you did while in the Web Design section? Well that <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> markup is going to be cutup into independent layouts in the view. The <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, Javascript and other assets actually remain where they are. The view is also where we implement <a href="#templating" title="web_application_development:php_-_server_side_architecture ↵" class="wikilink1">templating</a>, which is the practice of modularising user interfaces into reusable components so they can be swapped in and out with other user interface elements. In order to pull in dynamic data, we actually place variables inside the views which will be injected from the controller after the controller has the data from the model.
</p>

<p>
By convention we suffix views files with _view. So any file names would like <code>home_view.php</code>.

</p>
<pre class="code html4strict"><span class="sc2">&lt;?php defined<span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st0">'BASEPATH'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span> OR exit<span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st0">'No direct script access allowed'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span>; ?&gt;</span>

<h3 class="sectionedit10" id="controller">Controller</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
The controller is the manager of the model and view. In Codeigniter the name of the controller corresponds to the first <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> segment. The second <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> segment is executed as a corresponding method. Any further <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> segments are passed the methods as parameters. Controllers are meant to be thin and simply call upon models and pass in parameters, afterwards it binds the returned data to the view and at the same time responds back to the client with the finished data. The only business logic that controllers should have is any input filtering, <abbr title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> routing tasks, and view binding.
</p>

<p>
Example Codeigniter Controller:
</p>
<pre class="code php"><span class="co1">//This Home class corresponds to home.php as a filename, home then becomes the first URL segment as http://example.com/index.php/home or http://example.com/home (if using URL rewriting via Apache .htaccess)</span>

<h2 class="sectionedit11" id="templating">Templating</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Templating is the process of using layouts and partials to form complete view user interfaces. In following the separation of concerns, templates should contain as little business logic as possible. It&#039;s only there to bring together user interface elements and have dynamic data inserted into them. The problem comes when we want to have reusable partial templates and shared layout templates.
</p>

<p>
Think of layouts as a template file that specifies the header, footer, sidebar and any other elements that are shared across web pages and hardly change. A large web application may have multiple layouts, one for the blog, one for the administration panel, one for the home page. Each of which may have different headers or lack/include a sidebar. Layouts are the master templates, the templates that specifies other templates.
</p>

<p>
Think of partials as reusable templates across many different areas. An example would be a table row that may get used in different tables in different pages in different layouts. Partials are the grand children templates, templates that don&#039;t specify any other template and doesn&#039;t know which parent will pick it up to use it.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of templating libraries for <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>, some of them catered towards Codeigniter, and others are for generic use. Many of them provide their own domain specific language. You can choose to go with third party solutions, however I like to roll my own simpler solution. <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> after all was a templating language.
</p>

<p>
So I present to you the static helper class CiTemplating:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <a href="https://github.com/Polycademy/CiTemplating" class="urlextern" title="https://github.com/Polycademy/CiTemplating"  rel="nofollow">CiTemplating</a></div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can install it via composer (follow the instructions on the README) and it will be autoloaded, allowing you to call it like a global function without the need of instantiating it or using namespaces. Namespaces couldn&#039;t be used, due to the nature of templating, it would require an <code>use</code> namespace import, which would go against the concept of minimal logic views. Please see the section on <a href="#autoloading" title="web_application_development:php_-_server_side_architecture ↵" class="wikilink1">Autoloading</a> to find how to integrate autoloading magic into Codeigniter.
</p>

<p>
To use this library we need to establish some conventions:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Each controller you have should have a corresponding folder with a matching name in the view folder. Therefore a controller named <code>blog.php</code> should have the folder <code>views/blog</code>.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Each public method in a controller should have their own view with a matching name stored in their view controller folder. Therefore the controller <code>blog.php</code> with <code>articles</code> as a public method should have the view <code>views/blog/articles_view.php</code>.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Partials are appended with <code>_partial</code>, and are stored in the partials folder such as <code>views/partials/rows_partial.php</code>.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Layouts are appended with <code>_layouts</code>, and are stored in the layouts folder such as <code>views/layouts/main_layout.php</code>.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your views directory can start to look like this:
</p>
<pre class="code">views
  |
  |----layouts
  |       |
  |       |----main_layout.php
  |       |----admin_layout.php
  |       |----json_layout.php
  |
  |----partials
  |       |
  |       |----rows_partial.php
  |
  |----home
  |       |
  |       |----index_view.php
  |
  |----blog
          |
          |----articles_view.php</pre>

<p>
The CiTemplate static class provide a static <code>compose</code> method allowing you to define both views and their corresponding layouts. All layouts should inject a <code>$yield</code> variable. When you run <code>Template::compose()</code>, it will first sent any view data to the specified view, and return the compiled template, before dynamically adding it to the view data array and injecting it into the layout. For example, you should have a <code>default_layout.php</code> that is like this
</p>
<dl class="file">
<dt><a href="/doku.php?do=export_code&amp;id=web_application_development:php_-_server_side_architecture&amp;codeblock=10" title="Download Snippet" class="mediafile mf_php">default_layout.php</a></dt>

</dd></dl>

<p>
The corresponding call to this layout would be something like, if it was called inside the <code>index()</code> method of a controller..
</p>
<pre class="code php"><span class="re0">$view_data</span> <span class="sy0">=</span> <a href="http://www.php.net/array"><span class="kw3">array</span></a><span class="br0">&#40;</span>
    <span class="st_h">'header'</span> <span class="sy0">=&gt;</span> <a href="http://www.php.net/array"><span class="kw3">array</span></a><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">,</span>
    <span class="st_h">'footer'</span> <span class="sy0">=&gt;</span> <a href="http://www.php.net/array"><span class="kw3">array</span></a><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">,</span>
    <span class="st_h">'data'</span> <span class="sy0">=&gt;</span> <span class="st_h">'data_value'</span><span class="sy0">,</span>
    <span class="co1">//... etc</span>
<span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
Template<span class="sy0">::</span><span class="me2">compose</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st_h">'index'</span><span class="sy0">,</span> <span class="re0">$view_data</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span></pre>

<p>
The <code>$view_data[&#039;header&#039;]</code> and <code>$view_data[&#039;footer&#039;]</code> would be be injected into the partial parameters of <code>$header</code> and <code>$footer</code> in the layout. The rest of the properties in the view data array would be passed into the <code>index_view.php</code>, and the returned output would automatically be injected into the $yield. This obviously means you should not use have a property key of <code>$view_data[&#039;yield&#039;]</code> when defining your view data array, as it would get overwritten.
</p>

<p>
The compose method also has a third parameter that specifies the layout file to use. By default it is <code>default</code>. The compose method allows you to use full names such as <code>Template::compose(&#039;index_view&#039;, $view_data, &#039;default_layout&#039;);</code>, but it isn&#039;t necessary as it will automatically append <code>_view</code> or <code>_layout</code> to the end of the parameter if it doesn&#039;t have it. The same goes with partials.
</p>

<p>
A cool thing you can do with this method is to specify a JSON layout like so:
</p>
<dl class="file">
<dt><a href="/doku.php?do=export_code&amp;id=web_application_development:php_-_server_side_architecture&amp;codeblock=12" title="Download Snippet" class="mediafile mf_php">json_layout.php</a></dt>
<dd><pre class="code file php"><span class="kw2">&lt;?php</span> <a href="http://www.php.net/defined"><span class="kw3">defined</span></a><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st_h">'BASEPATH'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span> OR <a href="http://www.php.net/exit"><span class="kw3">exit</span></a><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st_h">'No direct script access allowed'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.php.net/header"><span class="kw3">header</span></a><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st_h">'Content-type: application/json'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
&nbsp;
<span class="kw1">echo</span> <a href="http://www.php.net/json_encode"><span class="kw3">json_encode</span></a><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="re0">$yield</span><span class="sy0">,</span> JSON_NUMERIC_CHECK <span class="sy0">|</span> JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span></pre>
</dd></dl>

<p>
You would call this via:
</p>
<pre class="code php"><span class="co1">//we pass false into the view, because don't need one to pass in straight json_data, json_data has to be an array too!</span>
Template<span class="sy0">::</span><span class="me2">compose</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="kw4">false</span><span class="sy0">,</span> <span class="re0">$json_data</span><span class="sy0">,</span> <span class="st_h">'json'</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span></pre>

<p>
To understand how the compose method works, look into the source code of <code>Template.php</code>. It&#039;s well documented.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT12 SECTION "Layouts" [29410-31904] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit13" id="partials">Partials</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Partials allow you define and call in reusable templates within templates. They also allow you to loop through results and repeat a compiled template with minimal logic. Partials are stored in the partials folder. Although it is possible to modify the code to allow partials anywhere in the view directory, I found it more appropriate and simpler to specify that all of them must be in one directory. Do note that it is possible to specify subdirectories in the partials folder though.
</p>

<p>
Partials are called within template views like so:
</p>
<pre class="code php"><span class="co1">//first parameter is the name of the partial with or without '_partial' appended to it, second parameter is the variable to pass in</span>
Template<span class="sy0">::</span><span class="me2">partial</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st_h">'header'</span><span class="sy0">,</span> <span class="re0">$header</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span></pre>

<p>
To loop through results you would need to pass <code>true</code> to the third parameter in your view file.
</p>
<pre class="code php">Template<span class="sy0">::</span><span class="me2">partial</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st_h">'row'</span><span class="sy0">,</span> <span class="re0">$row_data</span><span class="sy0">,</span> <span class="kw4">true</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span></pre>

<p>
This would call in a partial and attempt the iterate through <em>values</em> of the <code>$row_data</code>. The values are by default specified in the partial as <code>$row</code> variables. It is important to understand this. When you call <code>Template::compose()</code> to a view that has a looped partial, the view data array you pass in should have a property of which its key name matches the injected parameter of <code>Template::partial</code>. This property needs to also be an array, and its values are what is iterated over and stored in a <code>$row</code> variable. The partial can simply call <code>$row</code> if it&#039;s a scalar value, but if you need multiple properties in the <code>$row</code> variable, then the values that are iterated should also be an array.
</p>

<p>
Imagine you had a controller code like this:
</p>
<pre class="code php"><span class="re0">$view_data</span> <span class="sy0">=</span> <a href="http://www.php.net/array"><span class="kw3">array</span></a><span class="br0">&#40;</span>
    <span class="st_h">'row_data'</span> <span class="sy0">=&gt;</span> <a href="http://www.php.net/array"><span class="kw3">array</span></a><span class="br0">&#40;</span>
        <span class="st_h">'First Row'</span><span class="sy0">,</span>
        <span class="st_h">'Second Row'</span><span class="sy0">,</span>
        <span class="st_h">'Third Row'</span><span class="sy0">,</span>
    <span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">,</span>
<span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
&nbsp;
Template<span class="sy0">::</span><span class="me2">compose</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st_h">'table'</span><span class="sy0">,</span> <span class="re0">$view_data</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span>    </pre>

<p>
Then the view could be:
</p>
<pre class="code php">&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        <span class="sy1">&lt;?</span> Template<span class="sy0">::</span><span class="me2">partial</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st_h">'row'</span><span class="sy0">,</span> <span class="re0">$row_data</span><span class="sy0">,</span> <span class="kw4">true</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span> <span class="sy1">?&gt;</span>
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>

<p>
Then the partial would be:
</p>
<pre class="code php">&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;<span class="sy1">&lt;?=</span> <span class="re0">$row</span> <span class="sy1">?&gt;</span>&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;</pre>

<p>
Each of the <code>$row</code> would contain the scalar string of “First Row”, then “Second Row”, and finally “Third Row”.
</p>

<p>
If I wanted the <code>$row</code> to have multiple parameters, then I would change <code>$row_data</code> to be an array of arrays.
</p>
<pre class="code php">$view_data = array(
    'row_data' =&gt; array(
        array(
            'name' =&gt; 'Roger',
            'id' =&gt; '4'
        ),
        array(
            'name' =&gt; 'Dave',
            'id' =&gt; '5'
        ),
    ),
);
&nbsp;
Template::compose('table', $view_data);
&nbsp;
//and this would be in the partial
&nbsp;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;<span class="sy1">&lt;?=</span> <span class="re0">$row</span><span class="br0">&#91;</span><span class="st_h">'name'</span><span class="br0">&#93;</span> <span class="sy1">?&gt;</span>&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;<span class="sy1">&lt;?=</span> <span class="re0">$row</span><span class="br0">&#91;</span><span class="st_h">'id'</span><span class="br0">&#93;</span> <span class="sy1">?&gt;</span>&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;</pre>

<p>
As you can see array keys don&#039;t matter here.
</p>

<p>
By default they automatically echo their data as soon as they are called. However you can also specify that they return data as a variable by setting the fourth buffer parameter to true.
</p>
<pre class="code php"><span class="re0">$partial_compiled</span> <span class="sy0">=</span> Template<span class="sy0">::</span><span class="me2">partial</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st_h">'row'</span><span class="sy0">,</span> <span class="re0">$data</span><span class="sy0">,</span> <span class="kw4">false</span><span class="sy0">,</span> <span class="kw4">true</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span></pre>

<h2 class="sectionedit14" id="using_libraries">Using Libraries</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
One the key concepts of OOP is reusing code. Libraries are the primary way of reusing and sharing code. Whereas code in the MVC refers to a specific implementation of a particular web application. Libraries are created independently of what the web application does. Libraries can be a list of procedural functions, however these are usually called helper functions, and since we&#039;re using OOP, we should avoid using function lists which are hard to test, maintain, extend and impossible to autoload. Therefore our libraries will either be normal classes, abstract classes, interfaces or static classes.
</p>

<p>
There are different ways of structuring library classes, most of the ways are dependent on how best to autoload or not autoload the classes, and the usage or non-usage of namespacing. The PSR-0 (composer) standard was all about standardising sharable code libraries that could be autoloaded. However there are a number of other ways including Codeigniter&#039;s native library loading functionality, Codeigniter Sparks package management and of course rolling our own autoloading. This section will go through each and also discuss static classes.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT14 SECTION "Using Libraries" [34923-36098] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit15" id="codeigniter_libraries">Codeigniter Libraries</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Codeigniter allows you to create your own libraries and store them in the <code>application/libraries</code> folder. Follow the user guide on <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/general/libraries.html" class="urlextern" title="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/general/libraries.html"  rel="nofollow">loading libraries</a> and <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/general/creating_libraries.html" class="urlextern" title="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/general/creating_libraries.html"  rel="nofollow">creating libraries</a> for more information. For the purposes of autoloading convention, any library we create should be capitalised and camelcased. In the cases of interfaces and abstracts they should be prefixed with an <code>i</code> or <code>a</code> respectively. When you load a Codeigniter library using the Codeigniter loader, it will automatically instantiate the class into an object. So static classes will have to be loaded differently.
</p>

<p>
Codeigniter also provides a number of system libraries available for you to use. They provide a number of default functionality that we can take advantage of in order to avoid reinventing the wheel. Check out <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/toc.html" class="urlextern" title="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/toc.html"  rel="nofollow">Codeigniter&#039;s class and helper reference</a> for more information. Many of the functionality you need to run a generic web application is already available.
</p>

<p>
You can also replace and extend system libraries. You will need to either put them into the <code>application/core</code> or <code>application/libraries</code> folder. A good way to know, is to go into the <code>system/core</code> directory and see if the class you&#039;re trying to extend is there, and if it is, then it should be in the <code>application/core</code>. This is how people get customised controllers or loaders.
</p>

<p>
If you&#039;re replacing a native library. You would use the same name of the class you&#039;re trying to replace. But inside the class, you would call it CI_CLASSNAME. For example to replace the Email class. You would name it <code>Email.php</code> and have it run as <code>class CI_Email{}</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you&#039;re extending a native library just declare your class as MY_CLASSNAME extending CI_CLASSNAME. Furthermore if you&#039;re using a constructor, make sure to call the parent constructor with <code>parent::constructor();</code>.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="sparks">Sparks</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Before the days of Composer and PSR-0, Codeigniter had its own package and repository manager called Sparks. It is still in use today by legacy Codeigniter libraries and Codeigniter specific packages. So this will still be useful. However it hasn&#039;t been kept up to date with the latest develop branch version of Codeigniter, so in order to install we have to make a couple changes. See the <a href="/doku.php?id=web_application_development:solution_stack#sparks" class="wikilink1" title="web_application_development:solution_stack">solution stack on sparks</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>
You would have spark packages located at project root, and with the augmented <code>MY_Loader.php</code> you can load them via <code>$this→load→spark(&#039;example-spark/1.0.0&#039;);</code>, it is then usable as <code>$this→example_spark→method();</code>. Notice that we can&#039;t use hyphens <code>-</code>, when calling methods from classes as it confuses the interpreter as a syntax error. Packages either have to be underscored or camelcased.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT15 SECTION "Codeigniter Libraries" [36099-39045] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit16" id="composer_libraries">Composer Libraries</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Composer is one of the best things to come to <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> since sliced bread. There has been numerous attempts at package management for <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> in the past, but Composer is the best and most widespread in the modern day. Composer is not only an installer tool, but it is also a <a href="http://phpmaster.com/autoloading-and-the-psr-0-standard/" class="urlextern" title="http://phpmaster.com/autoloading-and-the-psr-0-standard/"  rel="nofollow">PSR-0 compliant autoloader</a>. What this means it will autoload classes and conform to namespace usage. This allows you to simply call <code>new Class</code> or typehint interfaces or <code>use</code> importing without having to actually <code>include</code> or <code>require</code> the files that the classes reside in. This magic is performed by modern versions of <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> providing autoload functions that hook into the loading architecture so we can augment it to automatically load what we want given a specified directory, naming style and namespace usage. Composer also allows non-PSR autoloading, so if you have some utility classes that you just want autoloaded, Composer can do that as well.
</p>

<p>
Try checking out the composer directory, look at how the packages are structured, and the common uses of namespaces in their source code.
</p>

<p>
However there&#039;s a problem. Codeigniter is a framework that caters to older versions of <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> users. So it&#039;s not natively integrated into Composer. However there are easy ways of integrating Composer into Codeigniter. Autoloading can be considered a form of bootstrapping. Essentially the autoloader should be available from the very start of initialising a web application. Where is the very start of our MVC architecture? It&#039;s in the front controller! So the simplest way of integration would be to simply <code>require_once</code> the Composer&#039;s <code>vendor/autoload.php</code> in Codeigniter&#039;s front controller which is the <code>index.php</code> at root. It would be <a href="http://pastebin.com/6ffYwdkf" class="urlextern" title="http://pastebin.com/6ffYwdkf"  rel="nofollow">somewhere at the end but before Codeigniter loads all the controllers</a>, or else we&#039;d try to load classes before the autoloader is registered.
</p>

<p>
However there is a better way, and in fact this “Polycademy” way actually gives us autoloading on your Codeigniter&#039;s <code>application/libraries</code> and <code>application/third_party</code> for free, and is more semantic with Codeigniter&#039;s architecture.
</p>

<p>
Now you can auto instantiate objects and call static methods from static classes anywhere, and that means both packages in Composer and packages/libraries in your <code>application/libraries</code> or <code>application/third_party</code>. However when constructing your library classes, do not use underscores in your filenames (excepting folder names) as they will be translated into directories. You need to follow the <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md" class="urlextern" title="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md"  rel="nofollow">PSR-0 rules</a> now. Capitalised and camelcased!
</p>

<p>
However if you classes that extend CI&#039;s native classes, you will not be able to autoload them. This is because the system classes that your classes are extending/replacing are not autoloaded as they are in the system directory. You&#039;ll need to use the native loader to load them. This does not conflict with the native loader.

At this point you have a flexible system utilising Composer, Sparks, Native CI and your own PSR-0 or class map loader.
</p>

<p>
In order to autoload classes in directories, you&#039;ll have to use namespaces.

Vendor/Package/Library style naming.

<p>
If the “use” keyword only points to a directory and not to a specific file, that all of those files become fair game. However you need to use the last namespace directory and prefix to all class initialisations. Like use Phpbounce\Mission_checker;
Then your initialisations would be new Mission_checker\Lint(); There&#039;s no need to specify the filenames. The filenames should always be the same as the class names. One class per file.

<h3 class="sectionedit19" id="static_classes">Static Classes</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Static classes are actually classes that have static member properties or methods. These properties and methods can be called without instantiating the class. They pretty much do the same thing a procedural function list, however they are more flexible to use and more consistent with OOP usage.
</p>

<p>
Static classes are alternatives to procedurally defining a large amount of helper functions that simply operate on data without storing any state itself. It&#039;s better to use static classes in OOP simply for two reasons. Consistency in software architecture and the fact that static classes can be autoloaded whereas function lists cannot. There will never be multiple instances of a static class because it doesn&#039;t store any state, you can use the same function for everything because it just operates of other things. Using the self:: way of calling static methods/variables also enforces a class scope and disciplines you towards single responsibility principle.
</p>

<p>
Why static classes? So static classes would usually be put in the helpers because they are not instantiated and CI&#039;s loader auto instantiates what it loads. However with the addition of an autoloader, we would instead put our static classes in the libraries folder.
</p>
<pre class="code">class lol{

	public static $auto = &#039;WHDFD&#039;;

	public function what(){
		$this-&gt;auto = &#039;auto&#039;;
	}

	public function no(){
		echo self::$auto;
		echo $this-&gt;auto;
	}

}

$lol = new lol;
$lol-&gt;what();
$lol-&gt;no();
</pre>

<p>
Static methods and variables or static classes:
1. Access static classes via self::$auto when inside the class. The self refers to the class, not the object. If you&#039;re calling static, you have use the fullname of the variable hence the $ at the start. When calling it as an object, you can just use the member name without the $. Such as $this→auto;
2. If the method is static, you can still instantiate the object and use it. But the $this will not be available inside the static class.
3. self:: will always refer to the variable when it was declared in the class.
4. self:: will not work when dynamically instantiating object instance properties or variables. Because they were not statically defined in the class.
