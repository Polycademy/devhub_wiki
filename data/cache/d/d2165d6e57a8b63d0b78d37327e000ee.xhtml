<a href="/polycademy_projects/devhub_wiki/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Auser_experience_design&amp;media=web_application_development:hassenzahls-model2.jpg" class="media" title="web_application_development:hassenzahls-model2.jpg"><img src="/polycademy_projects/devhub_wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=web_application_development:hassenzahls-model2.jpg" class="mediacenter" alt="" /></a>
</p>

<p>
One of the primary models of psychological user engagement is Hassenzahl&#039;s model. Hassenzahl&#039;s model assumes that the user assigns attributes to the product when using it. The attributes can all be grouped into four main categories: manipulation, identification, stimulation and evocation. These categories can, on a higher level, be grouped into pragmatic and hedonic attributes. Whereas the pragmatic attributes relate to the practical usage and functions of the product, the hedonic attributes relate to the user’s psychology.
</p>

<p>
The pragmatic attributes relate to manipulation of the software. Essentially, manipulation is about the core functionalities of a product. Typically, we relate these attributes to usability. A consequence of pragmatic qualities is satisfaction. Satisfaction emerges if a user uses a product or service to achieve certain goals and the product or service fulfills those goals.
</p>

<p>
The hedonic attributes firstly involve identification. The items connected to you right now could probably be used to get an idea of who you are and what you care about, even though some of them would be more important or descriptive than others. The secondary function of an object is to communicate your identity to others. Therefore, to fulfill this function, objects need to enable users to express themselves.
</p>

<p>
Next is stimulation. Stimulation in where a product feature satisfy the human urge for personal development, skills, insights and surprises. If your product can stimulate or educate your users, they will become followers and attaching a greater meaning to the product. A new trend in marketing is called content marketing, where companies establish themselves as thought leaders in a particular space related to their production.
</p>

<p>
Finally is evocation. Which is about recalling the past through memory. We enjoy talking and thinking about the good old days (even yesterday), and we want objects to help us with this. Souvenirs are a good example of a product that is mainly evocative. If your product can do achieve the previous three attributes for the intended user, then your product will be evocative.

<h3 class="sectionedit3" id="user_judgement">User Judgement</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it depends on who the beholder is and what they are doing. User judgement of user experience is, therefore, a complex process, which has been summarized the adaptive decision making chart. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="/polycademy_projects/devhub_wiki/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Auser_experience_design&amp;media=web_application_development:adaptive_decision_making_chart.png" class="media" title="web_application_development:adaptive_decision_making_chart.png"><img src="/polycademy_projects/devhub_wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=web_application_development:adaptive_decision_making_chart.png" class="mediacenter" alt="" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Users will assess the application according to their goals and the task domain. This stage will correspond to searching and locating a website or a software product.Next, the users’ goals and task influence the selection of the decision-making criteria.For example, in applications for serious use with more critical outcomes, content and usability will be favoured. Alternatively, for less serious use (e.g., entertainment, games), aesthetics and engagement will be favoured. The user’s experience will be judged against the dominant criterion or criteria appropriate for the application.The decision-making process is iterative, and users modify their opinions as their experience progresses. UE is, therefore, a complex multifaceted quality which may vary according to the application, the users’ expectations and context of use.For example, in work/goal-oriented applications, functionality, utility and usability are going to be more important.When applications are mobile, adaptation and context sensitivity will be important: while if the brand is valued, this exerts a positive influence on other criteria such as usability and aesthetics. For power users, the ability to customize and adapt the application will be key criteria. In contrast, for games and entertainment aesthetics, metaphors and interaction may be dominant.

<h3 class="sectionedit4" id="emotions">Emotions</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Emotion influences judgement, which affects memory. We remember events after unpleasant incidents more effectively than events beforehand. A bad usability experience will trigger emotions of frustration, anxiety and even anger. Since negative emotions tend to enhance memory of the situations and the immediate episode that gave rise to them, poor usability will be remembered and associated with the product in the future. This is of course a cognitive bias called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo effect" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo effect">halo effect</a>. Good design would evoke positive emotions, but our memory of them is weaker than negative emotions.

<h3 class="sectionedit5" id="flow_gamification">Flow &amp; Gamification</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow (psychology)" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow (psychology)">Flow</a> is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. You&#039;ll start to feel a lot of this while programming. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">Gamification</a> is the practice of incorporating game mechanics in non-game contexts in order to engage users and solve problems. These two concepts come into play if you&#039;re trying to gamify your web application. Do note that if your application is work related, gamification may simply slow your users down. On the other hand, gamification may enhance learning, co-operation, and engagement. The best example is the Q&amp;A site called <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/10/the-gamification.html" class="urlextern" title="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/10/the-gamification.html"  rel="nofollow">Stack Overflow</a>.
</p>

<p>
As we interact with a web application, we have to concentrate on deciding how to act and evaluating the consequences of our actions. Concentration is our ability to attend to a user interface or any task over a significant period of time; however, the strength of its influence depends on the difficulty of the task in hand and our previous experience. This means the concepts of flow and gamification come into play. We can learn from game designers in this regard.
</p>

<p>
Imagine encountering a new user interface. It&#039;s unfamiliar to previous interfaces. We&#039;ll decide what to do using heuristics. Our first engagement will be a slow-path judgement. Typically we&#039;ll try trial and error, e.g., push a few buttons and see what happens. Over time we&#039;ll gain an idea of common user interfaces, so we apply previous knowledge and general rules to operating web applications. We will apply rules to guess how to pull down menus, toggle button settings, or close windows by the X icon in the top right-hand corner. Eventually we are skilled and we apply fast-path decision making. Things run automatically and repetitively. Since we do not have to do much active thinking; hence, we find skilled, repetitive tasks boring.
</p>

<p>
We become less engaged when the operation is simple. This is a core concept in flow. When our skill surpasses the challenge level then it becomes boring. If your web application requires your user to be engaged, and creatively working out problems, then you need to manage the user&#039;s flow level and apply gamification to keep them interested.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/polycademy_projects/devhub_wiki/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Auser_experience_design&amp;media=web_application_development:472px-challenge_vs_skill.svg.png" class="media" title="web_application_development:472px-challenge_vs_skill.svg.png"><img src="/polycademy_projects/devhub_wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=web_application_development:472px-challenge_vs_skill.svg.png" class="mediacenter" alt="" /></a>
</p>

<p>
In work/goal-oriented applications, skilled operation and efficiency will be more important; hence, ease of learning and ease of use are paramount. But in entertainment and education domains, interaction that promotes arousal for engagement will be more important.
</p>

<p>
The question is how to achieve that optimal level of flow? Game designers try to manage this by managing the pace of change. Games need to maintain the pace of change with unpredictable events while not overwhelming the user with too much change that exceeds their capabilities.We rapidly get used to patterns of events leading
to decreased arousal as the unfamiliar becomes familiar. Web applications are not games though. The pace of change doesn&#039;t change by seconds. It&#039;s slower since it&#039;s not a real time game, however it can still be done, but at a slower pace.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/polycademy_projects/devhub_wiki/lib/exe/detail.php?id=web_application_development%3Auser_experience_design&amp;media=web_application_development:flow_pace.png" class="media" title="web_application_development:flow_pace.png"><img src="/polycademy_projects/devhub_wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=web_application_development:flow_pace.png" class="mediacenter" alt="" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Sophisticated games monitor the user’s behaviour and success rate and adapt the level of difficulty to maintain flow; less sophisticated versions provide a skill re-set control so the user can increase the difficulty of level as required.
</p>

<p>
This pace of change management is applied in Stack Overflow via its leveling up system. When you first sign up to Stack Overflow, you only get access to a few functions. You can post questions, but you cannot post comments, you cannot up vote or down vote. You don&#039;t have access to high level forums. As you ask questions and answer questions, you gain points and level up. Your levels grant you not only badges but extra functionality. More importantly this functionality is actually two things: creative power and prestige. These can be translated into two other things that humans crave: responsibility and presence. When your user gains power and correspondingly responsibility, then their actions have meaning. When your user has prestige, then they have presence. They exist, they matter to other people. This a core driver of most human passions.
</p>

<p>
Both of these contribute to flow. The first contributes more to short-term flow. Those brief bursts of focus. Whereas the second contributes more to long term flow.
</p>

<p>
These reasons are also why multiplayer games last longer than single player games. Creative power and prestige are only real when you&#039;re interacting with other humans. Which means that although gamification can work in a binary computer ⇔ person communication, it&#039;s true strength relies on social networks. This is why Facebook will still be used even if Facebook decides to take a break from innovating. As long as its running, it has social value. Another interesting fact is that people take Facebook conversations far more seriously than anonymous conversations. The fact that your identity is on the line makes the stakes higher for prestige. When there is volatile rewards or punishments, then the challenge level increases.

<p>
In terms of pace of change, one thing that consistently keeps humans engaged is interesting creative conversation. Have you ever tried talking to a computer? It&#039;s isn&#039;t really fun unless the computer is telling you a story you haven&#039;t heard. However with humans, the stories can be infinite. The power of conversation can also be applied to web application flow. Social presence theory argues that different communication channels and representations promote more or less sense of social presence, i.e., awareness of the identity, location and personalities of other people. Email as an asynchronous conversation is the least engaging since the time gap between turns destroys the sense of a dialogue, whereas instant messaging (IM) approaches synchronous exchange and become more engaging. In IM, the pace of exchange approaches a conversation and the sense of presence increases. Adding video or even still images improves presence by providing more information about the other person. It can be concluded that real time messaging can improve engagement, however it is usually not persistent, so although creative power is increased, prestige isn&#039;t, since nobody will remember it.

<h2 class="sectionedit6" id="design_process">Design Process</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The process of designing user experiences is numerous. However common ways of doing this include constructing use cases, scenarios and then iterating with A/B testing.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT6 SECTION "Design Process" [11813-12008] -->
<h3 class="sectionedit7" id="use_cases_workflow">Use Cases &amp; Workflow</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
User experience design should begin from the user. It needs to understand the user’s requirements and then come up with solutions. Ideally, users should participate in the design process and contribute ideas and solutions themselves, thus helping to engage them in the design process and hence increase their sense of ownership of the design. Using the user input, we construct scenarios, story boards and prototypes in an iterative cycle of solving requirements. The agile workflow allows us to explore designs and get user feedback quickly.
</p>

<p>
Here&#039;s a scenario template in words. It can be accompanied with drawings, flow diagrams, but this is the simplest textual form. This template can then be used in BDD testing.
</p>
<pre class="code">Title
  The story should have a clear, explicit title.
Narrative
  who (which business or project role) is the driver or primary stakeholder of the story (the actor who derives business benefit from the story)
  which effect the stakeholder wants the story to have
  what business value the stakeholder will derive from this effect
Acceptance criteria or scenarios
  It starts by specifying the initial condition that is assumed to be true at the beginning of the scenario. This may consist of a single clause, or several.
  It then states which event triggers the start of the scenario.
  Finally, it states the expected outcome, in one or more clauses.</pre>

<p>
Now here&#039;s an example scenario.
</p>
<pre class="code">Story: Returns go to stock

In order to keep track of stock
As a store owner
I want to add items back to stock when they&#039;re returned

Scenario 1: Refunded items should be returned to stock
Given a customer previously bought a black sweater from me
And I currently have three black sweaters left in stock
When he returns the sweater for a refund
Then I should have four black sweaters in stock</pre>

<p>
One limitation of scenarios is a potential bias towards exceptional and rare events, or towards the viewpoint of an unrepresentative stakeholder. These biases are an acknowledged weakness of scenarios; however, some propose scenarios with ‘extreme characters’ that are deliberately exceptional to provoke constructive thought.

<div class="level3">

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B testing" class="interwiki iw_wp" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B testing">A/B testing</a> is about experimenting different methods of doing the same thing and comparing the results. It aims to identify ways a website or web application can maximise a desired output. Such as more clicks on your adverts. Or more completed purchase transactions on a retail site. 
</p>

<p>
A/B testing is done by creating two different pages or elements, and randomising their display to the user. So that 50% of your users see one page, and the 50% see the other page. Note that it doesn&#039;t have to be an entire page, it could be a change in colour for the purchase button. A/B testing isn&#039;t for functional changes, if something changes functionally and you want to test, it&#039;s better to release a beta. Instead it&#039;s more used for things that don&#039;t change the efficiency or features of the application, but something you just can&#039;t know until you experiment with it. Such as the optimal size of a purchase button or a different menu layout or different wording of a text advert.
</p>

<p>
A/B testing does have its flaws. We may be hungry for data, but we should be aware of statistical fallacies. Like small sample size and outlier bias. Don&#039;t rely on it to test everything. Sometimes the designer knows better.

<p>
Blind and deaf and disabled people use the internet as well. These people will require special features to allow them to access your website/web application. They are listed on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/"  rel="nofollow">WCAG page</a>. If you&#039;re designing a Government website or something that is of public importance, make sure to follow the guidelines.
