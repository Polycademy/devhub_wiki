<span class="co1">//this should be the configuration of the Pimple IOC container. It will be a config file, that is placed in the application/config, and it'll be autoloaded using Codeigniter's autoloader. Or it could be a hook, but it's more semantic to be a config file. And since we want it everywhere, we will use CI's autoloader (here now called the bootstrap autoloader). CI autoloader is separate from PSR-0 autoloader!</span>
